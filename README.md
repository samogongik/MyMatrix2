# MyMatrix
This project implements a template class Matrix, which includes a method calculating determinant.

The class is designed with strict exception safety guarantees, this is achieved by using a two-level container and compliance with the rule of five.

To test the calculation of determinant, random square matrices of size 100 are generated; separate tests are conducted for integers and rational numbers
